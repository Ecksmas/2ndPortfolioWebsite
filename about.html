                <p>
                    My interest for tech started from a young age when I succesfully installed a Pink Panther game as a
                    boy
                    despite my father's failure at it.
                    Since then, I have loved playing and tinkering with software, whether it would be smaller scripts or
                    modifying games.
                    In the summer of 2023 I finally made the jump from being a financial analyst to pursue a lifelong
                    dream/challenge as a software developer.

                            Every since my triumph technical triumph over my father, me and the computer started to
                            increasingly spend time with eacother
                            over the years to come.
                            Whether it would be scripting or using cheat engine to bend the games towards my will, or
                            hosting
                            Minecraft
                            servers for me and my friends and others to join by adventoursly opening the ports of my
                            home
                            network.
                            However, my first real step into coding would first start after I completed a B.A in Accounting in
                            Finance
                            and worked in that industry for a couple of years.
                            That experience pushed me into finally taking my hobby as a serious career. It all started
                            with
                            a
                            Java Bootcamp which
                            did not go as I expected, which led me to pursue courses online, start a interest in game
                            development and finally start
                            attending Chas Academy as a System Developer using C/C++.

                            I have always focused on not losing the birds eye view when performing I task as I believe
                            that
                            it
                            is easy
                            to get bogged down on the small details and lose the bigger picture. As such my analytical
                            prowes
                            lays in steering
                            clear on what I/the group needs to complete and avoid and scope creeps that may introduce
                            themselves
                            along the path.
                            My cross-disciplinary has further enforced and enabled me to think like a analyst and
                            programmer
                            in

                            I strive to garner a fair environment that focuses on success whether it be on a individual

                            group
                            level,
                            as I belive that everyone should pass the finishline if they are willing to put in the time.

                            have
                            worked with international teams and I am open in understanding different
                            cultures needs and expecation depening on what task there is to be executed. Working in a

                            (in a
