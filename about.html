    <div class="about-header-text">
        My interest for tech started from a young age when I succesfully installed a Pink Panther game as a boy despite my father failure at it.
        Since then, I have loved playing and tinkering with software, whether it would be smaller scripts or modifying games. 
        And at the end of 2023 i finally made the jump from being a financial analyst to pursue a lifelong dream/challenge as a software developer.

                Every since my triumph technical triumph over my father, me and the computer slowly fel more in love over the years to come.
                Whether it would be scripting or using cheat engine to bend the games towards my will, or hosting Minecraft
                servers for me and my friends and others to join by adventoursly opening the ports of my home network.
                However, my properly into coding would first start after i completed a B.A in Accounting in Finance and worked in the industry for a couple of years.
                That experience pushed me into finally taking my hobby as a serious career. It all started with a Java Bootcamp which
                did not go as I expected, which led me to pursue courses online, start a interest in game development and finally start 
                attending Chas Academy as a System Developer using C/C++.

            <h1 class="about-card-header">AS A ANALYTICAL MIND,</h1>
            <p class="about-card-paragraph">
                I have always focused on not losing the birds eye view when performing I task as I believe that it is easy
                to get bogged down on the small details and lose the bigger picture. As such my analytical prowes lays in steering
                clear on what I/the group needs to complete and avoid and scope creeps that may introduce themselves along the path. 
                My cross-disciplinary has further enforced and enabeld me to think like a analyst and programmer in high-preassure 
                environment.

            <h1 class="about-card-header">AS A TEAM PLAYER,</h1>
            <p class="about-card-paragraph">
                I strive to garner a fair environment that focuses on success whether it be on a individual or group level, 
                as I belive that everyone should pass the finishline if they are willing to put in the time. I have worked with international teams and I am open in understanding different 
                cultures needs and expecation depening on what task there is to be executed. Working in a team (in a leading or member role) is a fun undertaking 
                with all challenges included.
